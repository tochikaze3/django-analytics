# Dashboard in a Django application
This sample shows how you can create a reporting dashboard in your Django project. The data from an SQLite database is transferred to the client-side data visualization library ([Flexmonster](https://www.flexmonster.com/?r=git_vr)) using Ajax.


# How to run the project

To run the Django development server, execute the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Next, open the following URL in your browser:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/`

Enjoy!

# Using the Django Analytical Package:

After doing my research on what tools will suite your needs most perfectly, 
i discovered that out of Google analytics, flexmonster analytics and django-analytical, 
django analytical will provide you with the most concise and powerful tools you can ever ask for. Analytical and marketing tools ranging from kissmetrics, Google analytics, Chartbeat and Crazy egg can be used for the platform.
